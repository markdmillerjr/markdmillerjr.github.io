<h3>Wing Section Modification Code</h3>

The second, the ability to create a multi segment wing was also considerably more involved than originally thought. Though once I began to seriously consider the problem and work through each step, the solution became clear. When the feature was being written, I wished to make it as simple and intutive as possible for the user. Therefore, to modify the planform of a wing, the user only needs to select either the leading or trailing edges, select the line again to activate the point, and then slide the point over the required break point. Precise positioning is possible by selecting the text box and editing the coordinates directly.
