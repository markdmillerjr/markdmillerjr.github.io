Our senior capstone project entailed designing a supersonic transport capable of traveling 7,500NM at Mach 2.2 with 80 passengers. The aircraft had to meet the initial requirements, as well as the FAA, and ICAO requirements for passenger aircraft.

Our team consisted of 11 engineers split along 6 subsystems; aerodynamics, structures, weight and balance, propulsion, stability and control, and CAD.
The projected was separated into two phases; Phase 1 (Fall semester) was the preliminary design and analysis. Phase 2 (Spring semester) consisted of fabrication and wind tunnel testing of the model.

The project involved a preliminary design review (PDR) and a critical design review (CDR) to an independent panel of industry experts to judge the viability of the design.


Cotton is a horror-style text-based adventure game I developed using the functions and macros built from The Wizard's Game in [Conrad Barski's Land of Lisp](http://landoflisp.com/). Slightly more interesting and convoluted! (It is not that scary.)

To give you a flavor of the game, here is an excerpt from one run:

<hr>

<pre>
You open your eyes, and you are greeted by an unfamiliar ceiling.
Startled, you get to your feet and quickly scan your surroundings. It's
dark except for the stream of light coming from a crack on the only boarded
window in the room. You try to peek through the crack, but you cannot see
anything. You wonder where you are and who could have possibly brought you here.

<------------------------------------------------>

look
The room is a picture of decay with only a faded number identifying it as room-4. The bed you were
 lying on is stained with what looks like dried blood. Could it be your blood? No - it is not. The
 only way out of the room aside from the door to the corridor is a window that is boarded shut. It
 looks like it has been like that for decades. There is a door going west from here. You see a candle
 on the floor. You see a match on the floor.

pickup candle

The candle is now lit. It illuminates everything in the room.

walk west
The corridor is lit with the candle. It is so long that you cannot see to the end. You notice that
 there are words written on the wall. There is a door going east from here. There is a way going north
 from here. There is a door going south from here.
