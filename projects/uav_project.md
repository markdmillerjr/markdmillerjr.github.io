<h3>Project Overview</h3>

The UAV project is a concept whereas the endurance of the UAV is extended by docking with a quadcopter in mid-air and swapping out its depleted batteries for fresh ones. The project covers a range of disciplines including <i>aircraft design</i>, <i>mechanical design</i>, <i>electric motor design</i>, <i>PCB design</i>, <i>electronics integration</i>,<i>autonomous control</i>, <i>stereo camera vision</i>, and <i>machine learning</i>.
