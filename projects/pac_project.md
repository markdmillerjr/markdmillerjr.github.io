The Preliminary Aircraft Configurator (PAC) is a program I began to write in college on my free time. The goal is to be able to perform all of the preliminary aircraft analysis automatically instead of by hand, as is typically the case. PAC works by using an extensive database of existing aircraft, engines, and airfoils to design an entire aircraft according to preliminary empirical methods.

The program is currently under development, but is currently capable of estimating the takeoff weight, and initial CL vs. Alpha for the wing and empennage.
