<h3>Project Overview</h3>

<a href="pac_concept.html">Concept</a>

The Preliminary Aircraft Configurator (PAC) is a program I began to write in college on my free time. The goal is to be able to perform all of the preliminary aircraft calculations automatically instead of by hand, as is typically the case. PAC works by using an extensive database of existing aircraft, engines, and airfoils to design an entire aircraft according to preliminary empirical methods.

This project started out as an excuse to take a break from studying. I originally intended to just model an airplane, however I eventually realized I could do so much more which is how PAC has gotten so large, it usually takes me a hour or two to wrap my head around what I was previously working on.
