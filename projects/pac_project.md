The Preliminary Aircraft Configurator (PAC) is a program I began to write in college during my free time. The goal was to perform all of the preliminary aircraft calculations automatically instead of by hand, as is typically the case. PAC works by using an extensive database of existing aircraft, engines, and airfoils to design an entire aircraft according to preliminary empirical methods.
