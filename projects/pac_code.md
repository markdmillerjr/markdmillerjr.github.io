<h3>Code</h3>

All of the code for PAC is hosted on GitHub at the link on the page's home site. However, I would like to deep into two features of PAC that took a decent amount of effort and describe how they work in depth. One of the most significant features of PAC is the ability to model a wing with different airfoils for the root and tip, and the ability to create a multi segment wing relatively easily.
